### Some changes in Python 3.0:

1. Print is now a function
2. Views and iterators instead of lists
3. The rules for ordering comparisons have been simplified.
4. There is only one integer type left, i.e. int. long is int as well.
5. The division of two integers returns a float instead of an integer. "//" can be used to have the "old" behaviour.
